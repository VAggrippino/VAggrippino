# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vince

## About Me
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a lifelong love of IT.

A lot of my past experience was based on a <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack, but I switched to a JavaScript stack with <abbr title="MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS">MERN</abbr> a few years ago. I primarily do frontend work, but I still do some backend.

I started _playing around_ with computers when I was a kid and getting paid for it before I was 20. Some of the roles I've held are Help Desk, Systems Admin, Web Server Admin, and DBA, but when I discovered Programming, I never looked back. Once I started creating websites, I knew I had found my calling.

On the back end, I've done Perl/CGI, Java, PHP (pre-Laravel), and NodeJS.

On the front end, I've used tools like jQuery and Bootstrap, but I always preferred creating solutions with well crafted CSS and pure JavaScript. Recently, I've really enjoyed building projects with TypeScript and React.

All my favorite things begin and end on the computer, but I also enjoy the stereotypical _nerd_ things, video games, Science Fiction/Fantasy, and Anime.

Most of all, I love my wife and daughter... the source of all my inspiration.

I was born and raised in New York State, but I've had the good fortune to be able to visit and live in many other places. On the journey, I've picked up little bits of several different languages and I can speak Malay fluently.

I'm working on assembling a portfolio from past projects and a few interesting new ideas, but it's not ready yet. In the mean time, you can view some of my recent work at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/VAggrippino).
