# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Vince

## About Me
I'm a veteran Web Developer with a lifelong love of IT.

While a lot of my past experience was based on a <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack I've recently decided to focus on a JavaScript stack with the <abbr title="MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS">MERN</abbr> stack.

I started _playing around_ with computers when I was a kid and working with them before I was 20. I've been Help Desk, Systems Admin, Web Server Admin, and DBA, but once I discovered Programming, I never looked back. Once I started creating websites, I knew I had found my calling.

On the backend, I've done Perl/CGI, Java, PHP (pre-Laravel), and finally NodeJS, but I enjoy frontend development more. I'm very comfortable with JavaScript running in the browser and I seem to have developed a knack for interesting CSS challenges.

Although my favorite things begin and end on the computer, I enjoy the stereotypical _nerd_ things, video games, Science Fiction/Fantasy, and Anime.

Most of all, I love my wife and daughter... the source of all my inspiration.

I was born and raised in New York State, but I've had the good fortune to be able to visit and live in many other places. I've picked up a little bit of several different languages and I can speak Malay fluently.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on assembling building a portfolio from my past projects and a few new ideas.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use MongoDB with NodeJS.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting JavaScript or CSS challenges.
